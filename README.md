# TEJ-Summative
Welcome to the Official Github page of the Amazone Angeli (totally not a rip off of Amazon Alexa). This is a smart home like system that is capable of doing nearly anything you can imagine. You can tell it to take notes for you. It can tell you jokes, it can even turn on different appliances in your home! 

If you have any questions, feel free to email Meekyle Mondal (ammeekyle.mondal@student.tdsb.on.ca) or Jawad Mohammed (jawad.mohammed@student.tdsb.on.ca) for further clarification. I hope you enjoy the program!
